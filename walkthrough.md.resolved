# Complex Vector Space Implementation Walkthrough

## Overview
I have implemented the core components for a formal Complex Vector Space as requested. This serves as the foundation for the Quantum State Model.

## Changes
### [src/vector_space.py](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py)
- **[ComplexVector](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py#5-60) Class**:
    - Implements vector addition, scalar multiplication, and negation.
    - Includes [inner_product](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py#48-56) and [norm](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py#58-60) methods conforming to physics conventions (conjugate linear in the first argument).
    - Enforces dimension consistency.
- **[LinearOperator](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py#62-124) Class**:
    - Implements matrix-based linear operators.
    - Supports application to [ComplexVector](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py#5-60).
    - Supports composition (`@` operator) and adjoint calculation.

### Tests
- Created [tests/test_vector_space.py](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/tests/test_vector_space.py) covering [ComplexVector](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py#5-60) axioms.
- Created [tests/test_linear_operator.py](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/tests/test_linear_operator.py) covering [LinearOperator](file:///c:/Users/Asus/Desktop/complex_vector_space/src/vector_space.py#62-124) properties.

## Verification Status
> [!WARNING]
> **Automated verification could not be completed.**
> I located a Python executable at [C:\Users\Asus\anaconda3\python.exe](file:///Users/Asus/anaconda3/python.exe), but attempts to execute it via the terminal were unsuccessful (likely hangs or permission issues).

The code is syntactically correct and follows the implementation plan.

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd c:\Users\Asus\Desktop\complex_vector_space
   ```
3. Run the tests using your specific Python executable:
   ```cmd
   "C:\Users\Asus\anaconda3\python.exe" -m unittest discover tests
   ```
   *Note: If `python` is in your system PATH, you can just run `python -m unittest discover tests`.*

### Code Review Summary
- **ComplexVector**: Correctly implements vector space axioms (addition, scalar multiplication) and inner product.
- **LinearOperator**: Correctly implements matrix operations, composition, and adjoints.
- **Type Safety**: Uses type hints and validates dimensions at runtime.

## Next Steps
- Resolve the Python environment issue.
- Verify the implementation by running the provided tests.
- Proceed to build the full Quantum State Model on top of these primitives.
